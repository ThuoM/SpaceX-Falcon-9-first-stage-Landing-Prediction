## Overview

The SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction Project is a machine learning project that aims to predict the landing outcome of the first stage booster of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX has been making significant strides in reusability by successfully landing and reusing the first stage of their Falcon 9 rockets. This project seeks to leverage historical data on previous launches and landing outcomes to develop a predictive model for future landings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, including details such as the launch date, flight number, payload mass, orbit type, launch site, landing outcome, booster version, and more. The dataset is sourced from reliable and publicly available data on SpaceX launches.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for training machine learning models.

3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and perform feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive power.

4. Model Building: Train and evaluate various machine learning models to predict the first stage landing outcome.

5. Model Selection: Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation.

6. Deployment: Deploy the trained model to make real-time predictions for future SpaceX Falcon 9 launches.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved trained models after training.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.
